</heading<h1>&nbsp; &nbsp;Hi. My name is Ryan Smith. This webpage is all about me. </h1> 
    <h2>Some things you should know about me: I am 11 years old. I am a vegetarian. I go to Marsh Creek Sixth Grade Center. </h2>
    <h3>Some of my hobbies are Nerf wars, tennis, running, video games, board games, reading, engineering, chemistry, petting animals, roller coasters, music, watching television, and drawing.</h3>
    <h4>My favorite foods are chickpeas and anything made from them, seitan, and strawberries. My favorite animals are vampire bats, ravens, and housecats.</h4>
    <h4>My favorite games to play are Splatoon, Super Smash Bros., Kingsburg, Fluxx, Dragonfire, and D&D. I also like to watch Doctor Who, The Good Place, and The Flash.</h4>
    <h4>I play the trombone, the double bass, and the piano. I have a very tight schedule with all my activities, so I barely have any time for games. <br>
       But if I'm not doing an activity or homework, you can find me being running through my neighborhood, drawing birds at the park, <br>
       in my office, room, or basement. You can also find me at a tennis court, on my comfy sofa, or even at a gaming event somewhere. <br>
       I also like plays, so you can find me at some.</h4>
